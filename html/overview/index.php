                                                       frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics. We work on the nature of dark matter, the
                                                       large scale structure and expansion rate of the Universe, the relation of galaxies

                                The University of Utah is a key contributor to cutting-edge survey science. Faculty
                                                           play leadership roles in the DESI survey and the SDSS-IV and -V surveys, with the
                                                           University being a full institutional member and data repository of SDSS. Our faculty,
                                                           postdocs, and students also use a wide range of world-class facilities in their research,
                                                           including ALMA, HST, Gemini, VLT, Chandra, NuSTAR, and XMM, and are involved in gamma-ray
                                                           telescopes VERITAS, HAWC, and CTA. Analysis and simulations are performed at the University’s
                                                           Center for High Performance Computing. We also run a high impact astronomy outreach
                                                           program and participate in efforts to preserve Utah's unparalleled dark skies. Our
                                                           faculty are committed to training a talented and diverse group of students and postdocs.&nbsp;

                            <p>Astrophysicists study celestial bodies such as stars and galaxies by observing their
                                                       light emissions and particles. These two fields operate on very different scales:
                                                       one deals with subatomic particles, the other with the Universe at large. Yet they
                                                       intertwine when addressing some of our most profound scientific questions, such as
                                                       "What is the origin fate of the universe?" and "What is the nature of dark energy
                                                       that drives the accelerating expansion of the universe?"

                            <p>Researchers at the University of Utah’s Department of Physics and Astronomy are carrying
                                                       out large-scale computer calculations to recreate the conditions of the quark-gluon
                                                       plasma. We are able to study the formation of protons and neutrons as the Universe
                                                       cooled. Such information is vital to our understanding of how the Universe came into
                                                       being.
