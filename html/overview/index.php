                            <p>Our growing group of astronomy and astrophysics faculty members carry out exciting research on the
                                frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics. We work on the nature of dark matter, the
                                large scale structure and expansion rate of the Universe, the relation of galaxies
                                to their dark matter halos, the energetics of galaxy clusters, the history of the
                                Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the demographics of massive black holes, the Milky
                                Way’s stellar populations and interstellar medium, the astrophysics of compact objects, the sources of the
                                highest energy photons, and the formation of planetary systems.

                                The University of Utah is a key contributor to cutting-edge survey science. Faculty
                                play leadership roles in the DESI survey and the <a href="https://www.sdss.org">SDSS-IV and SDSS-V surveys</a>,
                                with the University being a full institutional member and the data repository of SDSS. Our faculty,
                                postdocs, and students also use a wide range of world-class facilities in their research,
                                including ALMA, HST, Gemini, Rubin, VLT, Chandra, NuSTAR, and XMM, and have close ties with the local gamma-ray and high-energy
                                astroparticles group. Analysis and simulations can be performed at the University’s
                                Center for High Performance Computing. We also run a high impact astronomy outreach
                                program and participate in efforts to preserve Utah's unparalleled dark skies. Our
                                faculty are committed to training a talented and diverse group of students and postdocs.

                            <p>If you are interested in interacting with the Astro Group, you can find us at the following events (listed times are for Fall 2023).

                                <li><b>Astro Lunch</b>: Wednesdays, noon-1p. People usually leave at noon from INSCC 305 for Student Union to have lunch together (some people bring their own lunch and some buy food at the Union).</li>
                                <li><b>Astro Coffee</b> (journal club): Wednesdays, 1-2p, INSCC 345. We discuss recent astronomy papers; while this discussion tends to be at the level of astronomy grad students, undergrad and first-year grad students are still very welcome. About monthly, we also discuss topics on inclusion and equity in astronomy.</li>
