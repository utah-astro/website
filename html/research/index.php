                            <p>Our group works on topics in the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics.  Here are summaries of our most active areas of research:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>Cosmology and the large-scale structure of the Universe.</b>
                            We look at how galaxies in the universe are patterned to
                            form clumps and clusters, connected by thin filaments, almost
                            like a cosmic sponge. One mysterious entity, dark matter,
                            helps form the clumps, while another, dark energy, is starting
                            to drive an accelerated expansion of these clumps away from each
                            other. A main goal is to identify both dark matter and dark energy.

                            <li><b>Galaxy evolution and dynamics.</b>  Galaxies, including our own
                            Milky Way, each contain billions of stars (give or take!), as well as
                            mysterious dark matter. We look to see how galaxies were assembled and
                            how they interact with each other, giving clues about the formation of
                            stars and the nature of dark matter.

                            Most, if not all, galaxies harbor supermassive black holes.
                            These exotic objects have the mass of millions to billions of
                            stars packed into a region of space smaller than our solar system.
                            We look at how these objects grow and influence the growth of
                            their host galaxies. Their origin remains a mystery....

                            <li><b>Stars in the Milky Way and the origins of elements.</b>
                            Stellar spectroscopy, the detailed analysis of starlight
                            in terms of its color, reveals the elements that make up stars.
                            By studying the how these elements are spread across
                            different populations of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy,
                            we can understand the origin of carbon, oxygen and other
                            elements of which we are composed. Spectroscopy also tells us about how the stars are moving, how old they are, and other properties that let us understand how the Milky Way formed and has changed over time.

                            <li><b>Dark matter.</b> Dark matter is known only
                            from its gravitational influence on visible stars and gas.
                            It's properties may be inferred from how it affects
                            galaxy clustering. A major goal of astronomy is to
                            detect dark matter directly by catching a rare
                            collision with normal atoms. Alternatively dark matter
                            may reveal itself in interactions that can lead to
                            showers of high energy particles. So far there
                            have been only tentative hints of detections. Thus,
                            the mystery continues.

                            <li><b>Experimental and Observational High Energy Astrophysics.</b> Utah is
                            part of VERITAS, HAWC, and TA collaborations looking
                            at high-energy particles in the cosmos. The
                            source of these particles is not entirely certain,
                            but some likely involve physics near the
                            edge of supermassive black holes.

                            <li><b>Planets.</b> Amidst dark energy and dark matter, within
                            huge galaxies and around stars, small particles of dust began
                            to glom together to form planets. Our view of planets in the
                            Universe has expanded from just a handful around our solar system
                            to thousands seen around other stars. We are working to understand
                            the mechanisms at play in the formation planets, in particular
                            rocky planets like our own Earth. Is this process universal and
                            do we have company in the Universe? [<a href="http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bromley/">Bromley</a>]
