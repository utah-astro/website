            <span>Ben's research is on planet formation, with recent emphasis on planets in our solar system. He also has interest in the fastest stars in our Galaxy, their enigmatic origin, and what they can tell us about the overall structure of the Milky Way. Ben works in these and other areas of astrophysics with the help of parallel supercomputers for dynamical simulation and data mining.</span>

            <span>Joel seeks to understand dark matter, currently by discovering new strong galaxy-galaxy lenses. His current role as the SDSS-IV archive scientist, and new role as the SDSS-V principal data scientist, put him at the center of the U’s effort to manage the Survey's data systems, which provides his research a tremendously useful data set.</span>
